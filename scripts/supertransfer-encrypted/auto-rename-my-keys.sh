# This script assumes you named your Service accounts like: ^GDSA[0-9]+$
# example: GDSA1 ... GDSA2 ... GDSA99
#
# EXAMPLE: the json key named derpyderp-8e3ec71f927d.json with the email:
# gdsa10@derpyderp-92374.iam.gserviceaccount.com
# will be renamed to gdsa10.json
# this is completely optional, but helps keep track if you made a lot of keys
#
# usage: place script in folder full of json keys
# this directory is in: /opt/appdata/plexguide/supertransfer
# (which is also where keys get dropped if using the web client to upload)
#
# cd /opt/appdata/plexguide/supertransfer
# ./auto-rename-my-keys.sh
